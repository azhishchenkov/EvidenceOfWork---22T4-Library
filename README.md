Added to create first commit. This
REPO for evidence of work documentation to reference files / multimedia / documents so that whomever reviews can easily access all material referenced by the document with ease from one central source.

Also to make my life easy as the compiler of the documentation and referenced evidence, whatever form,type,media format that may present, can be conquered by this 'Evidence of Work Library'

Who knows maybe a google drive folder would be better, about to fuck around and find out xx o_0 chenKov
